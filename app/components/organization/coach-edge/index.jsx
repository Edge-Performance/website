                            Edge is a routine-based mental skills hub, doubling
                            as a robust and secure content delivery system that
                            standardizes program delivery at scale across your
                            organization. With built in two-way communication,
                            Edge is a force multiplier for coaches that will
                            exponentially increase touch points with your
                            athletes. The ability to add to your current
                            metrics’ regular data about an athlete's trends and
                            mental routine brings a whole new dynamic to
                            performance. Imagine understanding how your
                            athlete’s focus is impacted by training breathwork
                            the night before a game. That could be the
                            difference between good and great, helping create a
                            culture where athletes are encouraged to re-commit
                            daily, feeling more prepared, informed and
                            supported.
